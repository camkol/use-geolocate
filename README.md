## My process

- In this app, the user inputs an amount and selects two currencies to convert between.
- The app uses the Frankfurter API to fetch the exchange rate based on the selected currencies and input amount.
- When the user changes the input amount or selects different currencies, the `useEffect` hook triggers the `fetchConvert` function to make an API request.
- The API response provides the exchange rate, which is then used to calculate the converted value.
- The result is displayed in the output component, showing the converted amount along with the target currency.
- The app consists of three main parts: input, currency selection, and output, all managed with state variables for dynamic updates.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a class project to learn about custom hooks.

### Continued development

maybe use later
